Market Shipment Simulation

Overview
This Java project is designed to simulate a market shipment process, implementing concepts such as Exception Handling, Generics, Collections, and Object-Oriented Design. The simulation tracks the production, boxing, and shipping of items, calculating profit and managing data flow from CSV files.

Features

Dynamic Item Production: Produce countable and uncountable items based on dynamic inputs from a commands.csv file.
Complex Packaging Logic: Items are packed into specific boxes (countable or uncountable) and then loaded into containers.
Profit Calculation: Simulates shipping of containers and calculates profit, handling costs, and revenue generation.
Robust Error Handling: Implements custom exceptions for rule violations without terminating the simulation.
Customizable Input: Works with various CSV files to modify the simulation without changing the codebase.

Simulation Steps
Item Production: Items are produced individually with unique properties.
Box and Container Production: Items are placed into appropriate boxes which are then loaded into containers.
Shipping: Containers are shipped, and profit is generated based on the items’ properties.
Revenue Management: Tracks unearned revenue from unshipped items and total revenue.

Prerequisites
Java JDK 11 or higher
Eclipse IDE (recommended, though the project is compatible with other IDEs)
